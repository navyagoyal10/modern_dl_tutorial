# PyTorch Deep Learning Curriculum

A self-study curriculum for building deep learning implementation skills from the ground up using PyTorch. Covers CNNs, transfer learning, contrastive learning, object detection, transformers, language models, vision transformers, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning — ending in a multimodal capstone.

Designed for someone with theoretical background in machine learning who wants to build strong practical and implementation intuition.

## Credits

Curriculum designed and authored by **Samyak Sanghvi**.

Assignments draw on concepts and problem settings from **COL780: Computer Vision** and **COL772: Natural Language Processing** (IIT Delhi). The datasets, architectural targets, and evaluation protocols are inspired by coursework from both courses, adapted for self-study.

## How to use this curriculum

1. Read `RESOURCES.md` briefly to get an overview of the supplementary material available.
2. Start at A01. Do not skip it even if it feels basic — the training loop infrastructure you build there is reused in every subsequent assignment.
3. Each `README.md` tells you exactly which prior assignments it depends on. Do not start an assignment until its dependencies are complete.
4. Run the `download_data.py` script in each folder before anything else. Data downloads can be slow — start them before reading the theory.
5. The RESOURCES.md entry for each assignment lists what to read and when. Use it as a reading schedule alongside the implementation work.
