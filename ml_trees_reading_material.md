## Mathematical Foundations

### 1. Classification: Impurity Measures

#### Gini Impurity

**Definition**: Measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset.

**Formula**:
```
Gini(S) = 1 - Σ(p_i)²
```

where `p_i` is the proportion of class `i` in set `S`.

**Derivation**:
- Probability of picking an element from class `i`: `p_i`
- Probability of misclassifying it (labeling it as any other class): `1 - p_i`
- Expected misclassification rate: `Σ p_i(1 - p_i) = Σ p_i - Σ(p_i)² = 1 - Σ(p_i)²`

**Properties**:
- Range: [0, 0.5] for binary classification
- Gini = 0: Pure node (all samples are the same class)
- Gini = 0.5: Maximum impurity (equal distribution in binary case)
- Gini for multi-class: max impurity = (K-1)/K where K = number of classes

**Example**:
```
Node with 7 Yes, 3 No:
Gini = 1 - (0.7)² - (0.3)² = 1 - 0.49 - 0.09 = 0.42

Pure node with 10 Yes, 0 No:
Gini = 1 - (1.0)² - (0.0)² = 0.0
```

#### Entropy / Information Gain

**Definition**: Measures the average amount of information needed to identify the class of an element.

**Formula**:
```
Entropy(S) = -Σ p_i log₂(p_i)
```

Convention: 0 log₂(0) = 0

**Information Gain**:
```
IG(S, A) = Entropy(S) - Σ (|S_v| / |S|) × Entropy(S_v)
```

where:
- `S` = dataset
- `A` = attribute to split on
- `S_v` = subset where attribute A = v
- `|S|` = number of samples

**Derivation from Information Theory**:
- Shannon entropy measures average surprise/uncertainty
- log₂(1/p_i) = bits needed to encode event with probability p_i
- Expected value: Σ p_i × log₂(1/p_i) = -Σ p_i log₂(p_i)

**Properties**:
- Range: [0, log₂(K)] where K = number of classes
- Entropy = 0: Pure node
- Entropy = log₂(K): Maximum uncertainty (uniform distribution)
- For binary: max entropy = 1 bit

**Example**:
```
Node with 7 Yes, 3 No:
Entropy = -0.7 log₂(0.7) - 0.3 log₂(0.3)
        = -0.7(-0.515) - 0.3(-1.737)
        = 0.360 + 0.521 = 0.881 bits

Pure node:
Entropy = -1.0 log₂(1.0) = 0 bits
```

#### Gini vs Entropy: Which to Use?

**Computational Cost**:
- Gini: Only squares and sums → faster
- Entropy: Requires logarithms → ~2x slower

**Behavior**:
- Both are concave functions that peak at 0.5 (binary case)
- Gini tends to isolate the most frequent class in its own branch
- Entropy tends to produce more balanced trees
- In practice: differences are minor (<2% accuracy difference)

**Recommendation**: Use Gini (sklearn default) unless you have a specific reason for entropy.

**Numerical Comparison** (binary classification):

| p(Yes) | Gini     | Entropy |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 0.0    | 0.000    | 0.000   |
| 0.1    | 0.180    | 0.469   |
| 0.3    | 0.420    | 0.881   |
| 0.5    | 0.500    | 1.000   |
| 0.7    | 0.420    | 0.881   |
| 0.9    | 0.180    | 0.469   |
| 1.0    | 0.000    | 0.000   |

### 2. Regression: Variance Reduction

#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

**Definition**: Average squared deviation from the mean.

**Formula**:
```
MSE(S) = (1/n) Σ(y_i - ȳ)²
```

where:
- `y_i` = target value of sample i
- `ȳ` = mean of target values in set S
- `n` = number of samples

**Equivalent form** (variance):
```
Var(S) = MSE(S) = E[Y²] - E[Y]²
```

**For splitting**:
```
Weighted MSE = Σ (|S_v| / |S|) × MSE(S_v)
```

We choose the split that minimizes this weighted MSE.

**Why MSE?**:
- Differentiable (nice for optimization)
- Penalizes large errors more than small errors (quadratic)
- Related to L2 loss in linear regression
- Mathematically tractable

**Example**:
```
Node with values: [300k, 320k, 280k, 310k]
Mean = 302.5k

MSE = (1/4)[(300-302.5)² + (320-302.5)² + (280-302.5)² + (310-302.5)²]
    = (1/4)[6.25 + 306.25 + 506.25 + 56.25]
    = (1/4)[875]
    = 218.75

After split into [300k, 280k] and [320k, 310k]:
Left MSE = (1/2)[(300-290)² + (280-290)²] = 100
Right MSE = (1/2)[(320-315)² + (310-315)²] = 25
Weighted MSE = (2/4)×100 + (2/4)×25 = 62.5
Reduction = 218.75 - 62.5 = 156.25 ✓
```

#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Alternative to MSE**:
```
MAE(S) = (1/n) Σ|y_i - median(S)|
```

**Properties**:
- More robust to outliers than MSE
- Less commonly used (harder to optimize)
- sklearn: `criterion='absolute_error'` for regressors

**When to use MAE**:
- Dataset has extreme outliers
- Want predictions to be less influenced by rare extreme values

### 3. Splitting Criterion Comparison

| Criterion | Type          | Formula                  | Advantages                | Disadvantages              |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Gini      | Classification| 1 - Σ(p_i)²             | Fast, isolates frequent   | May create unbalanced trees|
| Entropy   | Classification| -Σ p_i log₂(p_i)        | Balanced trees            | Slower (log computation)   |
| MSE       | Regression    | (1/n)Σ(y_i - ȳ)²        | Smooth, differentiable    | Sensitive to outliers      |
| MAE       | Regression    | (1/n)Σ\|y_i - median\|  | Robust to outliers        | Harder to optimize         |

## Decision Tree Algorithm Details

### CART (Classification and Regression Trees) Algorithm

**Pseudocode**:

```python
def build_tree(data, depth=0, max_depth=None, min_samples_split=2):
    """
    Recursively build a binary decision tree
    """
    n_samples = len(data)
    
    # Stopping criteria
    if (depth == max_depth or 
        n_samples < min_samples_split or 
        is_pure(data)):
        return create_leaf(data)
    
    # Find best split
    best_feature, best_threshold, best_gain = None, None, -inf
    
    for feature in features:
        for threshold in get_candidate_thresholds(data[feature]):
            gain = calculate_gain(data, feature, threshold)
            
            if gain > best_gain:
                best_gain = gain
                best_feature = feature
                best_threshold = threshold
    
    # No improvement possible
    if best_gain <= 0:
        return create_leaf(data)
    
    # Split and recurse
    left_data = data[data[best_feature] <= best_threshold]
    right_data = data[data[best_feature] > best_threshold]
    
    left_subtree = build_tree(left_data, depth+1, max_depth, min_samples_split)
    right_subtree = build_tree(right_data, depth+1, max_depth, min_samples_split)
    
    return Node(best_feature, best_threshold, left_subtree, right_subtree)
```

### Handling Categorical Features

**Two approaches**:

1. **Binary encoding** (One-Hot Encoding):
   - Convert each category into a binary feature
   - Example: Color ∈ {Red, Blue, Green} → is_Red, is_Blue, is_Green
   - Works with standard CART algorithm

2. **Multi-way splits**:
   - For feature with K categories, try all 2^(K-1) - 1 partitions
   - Computationally expensive for high-cardinality features
   - sklearn doesn't support this natively (use category_encoders library)

**Handling missing values**:
- Option 1: Drop rows with missing values
- Option 2: Impute with mean/median/mode before tree building
- Option 3: Surrogate splits (advanced, not in sklearn)
- Option 4: Treat missing as its own category

### Computational Complexity

**Training time**:
- Finding best split for one feature: O(n log n) for sorting
- Trying all features: O(d × n log n) where d = number of features
- Building entire tree: O(d × n log n × depth)
- Worst case depth: O(n) (degenerate tree)
- Balanced tree depth: O(log n)

**Overall**: O(d × n log n × log n) = O(d × n × log²n) for balanced trees

**Prediction time**:
- Traverse from root to leaf: O(depth)
- Balanced tree: O(log n)
- Worst case: O(n)

**Space complexity**:
- Storing tree: O(number of nodes)
- Balanced tree: O(2^depth) nodes
- Can be reduced by pruning

---

## Pruning Strategies

Overfitting is the main problem with decision trees. Pruning helps control model complexity.

### 1. Pre-Pruning (Early Stopping)

**Stop splitting when**:

- `max_depth` reached:
  ```python
  DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)
  ```
  - Typical values: 3-10 for interpretable models, 10-20 for ensembles
  - Too low: underfits, too high: overfits

- `min_samples_split` threshold:
  ```python
  DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_split=20)
  ```
  - Minimum samples required to split a node
  - Typical: 2-50

- `min_samples_leaf` threshold:
  ```python
  DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=10)
  ```
  - Minimum samples required in a leaf
  - Prevents tiny leaves that overfit

- `max_leaf_nodes` limit:
  ```python
  DecisionTreeClassifier(max_leaf_nodes=50)
  ```
  - Caps total number of leaves
  - Uses best-first search instead of depth-first

- `min_impurity_decrease`:
  ```python
  DecisionTreeClassifier(min_impurity_decrease=0.01)
  ```
  - Split must reduce impurity by at least this amount
  - Filters out weak splits

**Pros**: Fast, simple, happens during training
**Cons**: May stop too early (greedy decision)

### 2. Post-Pruning (Cost-Complexity Pruning)

**Build full tree, then prune back**:

**Cost-Complexity criterion**:
```
R_α(T) = R(T) + α|T|
```

where:
- `R(T)` = error rate of tree T on validation set
- `|T|` = number of leaves
- `α` = complexity parameter (higher α → more pruning)

**Algorithm** (sklearn's `ccp_alpha`):

1. Build full tree
2. For each α value, find the smallest subtree that minimizes R_α(T)
3. Evaluate on validation set
4. Choose α that gives best validation performance

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Get pruning path
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
path = clf.cost_complexity_pruning_path(X_train, y_train)
ccp_alphas = path.ccp_alphas

# Try different alphas
best_alpha = None
best_score = 0

for alpha in ccp_alphas:
    clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(ccp_alpha=alpha)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    score = clf.score(X_val, y_val)
    
    if score > best_score:
        best_score = score
        best_alpha = alpha

# Train final model
final_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(ccp_alpha=best_alpha)
final_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Pros**: More principled, can achieve better bias-variance tradeoff
**Cons**: Slower (requires validation set and multiple training runs)

### Reduced Error Pruning (REP)

**Simple alternative**:

1. Build full tree on training set
2. For each internal node, from bottom up:
   - Try replacing the subtree with a leaf
   - If validation accuracy improves (or stays same), prune
3. Continue until no more improvements

**Implementation sketch**:
```python
def reduced_error_pruning(tree, X_val, y_val):
    """
    Prune tree based on validation performance
    """
    improved = True
    
    while improved:
        improved = False
        baseline_score = tree.score(X_val, y_val)
        
        for node in tree.get_internal_nodes():
            # Try pruning this subtree
            original_subtree = node.copy()
            node.convert_to_leaf()
            
            new_score = tree.score(X_val, y_val)
            
            if new_score >= baseline_score:
                # Keep it pruned
                improved = True
                baseline_score = new_score
            else:
                # Restore original subtree
                node.restore(original_subtree)
    
    return tree
```

---

## Random Forest Deep Dive

### 1. Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)

**Core idea**: Train multiple models on different random subsets and average their predictions.

**Bootstrap sampling**:
```python
def bootstrap_sample(data, n_samples=None):
    """
    Sample with replacement from data
    """
    if n_samples is None:
        n_samples = len(data)
    
    indices = np.random.randint(0, len(data), n_samples)
    return data[indices]
```

**Key insight**: Each bootstrap sample contains ~63.2% unique samples.

**Derivation**:
- Probability of NOT being selected in one draw: (n-1)/n
- Probability of NOT being selected in n draws: ((n-1)/n)^n
- As n → ∞: ((n-1)/n)^n → 1/e ≈ 0.368
- Therefore, probability of being selected: 1 - 1/e ≈ 0.632

### 2. Random Feature Selection

**At each split**:
- Don't consider all d features
- Randomly select m features to consider
- Choose best split among those m features

**Typical values**:
- Classification: m = √d (sklearn default: `max_features='sqrt'`)
- Regression: m = d/3 (sklearn default: `max_features=1.0/3.0`)

**Why does this help?**:
- Decorrelates trees
- If one feature is very strong, bagging alone would create similar trees
- Random features forces diversity

**Example**:
```
Dataset with 100 features:
- Classification RF: each split considers √100 = 10 random features
- Regression RF: each split considers 100/3 ≈ 33 random features
```

### 3. Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error

**Free validation estimate**:

Since each tree is trained on ~63% of data, the remaining ~37% can be used for validation.

**OOB Score calculation**:
```python
def calculate_oob_score(forest, X, y):
    """
    Calculate out-of-bag score for random forest
    """
    n_samples = len(X)
    oob_predictions = np.zeros(n_samples)
    oob_counts = np.zeros(n_samples)
    
    for tree, bootstrap_indices in zip(forest.trees, forest.bootstrap_indices):
        # OOB samples for this tree
        oob_mask = ~np.isin(np.arange(n_samples), bootstrap_indices)
        oob_indices = np.where(oob_mask)[0]
        
        # Predict on OOB samples
        predictions = tree.predict(X[oob_indices])
        
        # Accumulate
        oob_predictions[oob_indices] += predictions
        oob_counts[oob_indices] += 1
    
    # Average predictions
    oob_predictions = oob_predictions / oob_counts
    
    # Calculate accuracy
    return accuracy_score(y, oob_predictions)
```

**Usage in sklearn**:
```python
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, oob_score=True)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"OOB Score: {rf.oob_score_}")
```

**Advantages**:
- No need for separate validation set
- More data available for training
- Good estimate of generalization error

### 4. Feature Importance

**Two methods in sklearn**:

**Method 1: Impurity-based (default)**:
```python
importance_i = Σ (weighted impurity decrease at splits using feature i) / Σ (all impurity decreases)
```

- Fast to compute
- Available immediately after training
- Biased toward high-cardinality features

**Method 2: Permutation-based**:
```python
from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance

result = permutation_importance(rf, X_test, y_test, n_repeats=10)
importances = result.importances_mean
```

- Shuffle feature i, measure drop in accuracy
- More reliable but slower
- Works with any model

**Usage**:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Get feature importances
importances = rf.feature_importances_
indices = np.argsort(importances)[::-1]

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(range(X.shape[1]), importances[indices])
plt.xticks(range(X.shape[1]), [feature_names[i] for i in indices], rotation=90)
plt.title("Feature Importances")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### 5. When Random Forest Fails

**Not suitable for**:
- High-dimensional sparse data (text with TF-IDF)
- Small datasets (< 1000 samples)
- Linear relationships (use linear model instead)
- Extrapolation (RFs can't predict beyond training range)

**Example of extrapolation failure**:
```python
# Train on data where target is in range [0, 100]
X_train = np.linspace(0, 10, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
y_train = 10 * X_train.flatten()

rf = RandomForestRegressor()
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Test on data where target should be 150
X_test = np.array([[15]])
print(rf.predict(X_test))  # Will predict ~100, not 150!
```

Trees can only output values they've seen in training leaves.

## Gradient Boosting Internals

### 1. Boosting Framework

**Key idea**: Build trees sequentially, each correcting errors of the previous ensemble.

**General framework**:
```
F₀(x) = initial guess (e.g., mean of y)

For m = 1 to M:
    1. Calculate residuals: r_i = y_i - F_{m-1}(x_i)
    2. Fit tree h_m to residuals
    3. Update: F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + ν × h_m(x)
    
Final prediction: F_M(x)
```

where ν is the learning rate.

### 2. Gradient Boosting for Regression

**Mathematical formulation**:

Minimize loss function:
```
L(y, F(x)) = Σ ℓ(y_i, F(x_i))
```

For MSE: ℓ(y, F(x)) = (y - F(x))²

**Gradient descent in function space**:

The negative gradient of MSE:
```
-∂L/∂F(x_i) = 2(y_i - F(x_i)) = 2 × residual
```

So fitting to residuals = gradient descent!

**Algorithm**:
```python
def gradient_boosting_regressor(X, y, n_trees, learning_rate, max_depth):
    """
    Gradient boosting for regression
    """
    # Initialize with mean
    F = np.full(len(y), np.mean(y))
    trees = []
    
    for m in range(n_trees):
        # Calculate negative gradient (residuals)
        residuals = y - F
        
        # Fit tree to residuals
        tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=max_depth)
        tree.fit(X, residuals)
        
        # Update predictions
        F += learning_rate * tree.predict(X)
        
        trees.append(tree)
    
    return trees

def predict(X, trees, learning_rate, initial_value):
    """
    Make predictions with gradient boosting model
    """
    F = np.full(len(X), initial_value)
    
    for tree in trees:
        F += learning_rate * tree.predict(X)
    
    return F
```

### 3. Gradient Boosting for Classification

**Binary classification with log loss**:

Loss function:
```
ℓ(y, F(x)) = log(1 + exp(-y × F(x)))
```

where y ∈ {-1, +1} and F(x) is the raw score (before sigmoid).

**Gradient**:
```
-∂ℓ/∂F(x) = y / (1 + exp(y × F(x)))
```

**Pseudo-residuals**:
```
r_i = y_i / (1 + exp(y_i × F(x_i)))
```

**Convert to probability**:
```
P(y=1|x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-F(x)))
```

### 4. XGBoost Improvements

**Key innovations**:

1. **Second-order approximation**:
   - Uses both gradient and Hessian (second derivative)
   - More accurate updates

2. **Regularization**:
   ```
   Obj = Σ ℓ(y_i, F(x_i)) + Σ Ω(f_m)
   
   where Ω(f) = γT + (λ/2)||w||²
   ```
   - γ: penalty for number of leaves T
   - λ: L2 penalty on leaf weights

3. **Column (feature) sampling**:
   - Like RF, subsample features per tree
   - Reduces overfitting and speeds up training

4. **Sparsity-aware split finding**:
   - Handles missing values efficiently
   - Learns best direction for missing values

5. **Approximate split finding**:
   - Quantile sketch algorithm for large datasets
   - Bins continuous features

**Hyperparameters**:
```python
import xgboost as xgb

model = xgb.XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,        # Number of trees
    learning_rate=0.1,       # η (eta): shrinkage
    max_depth=6,             # Maximum tree depth
    min_child_weight=1,      # Minimum sum of instance weights in leaf
    gamma=0,                 # Minimum loss reduction for split
    subsample=0.8,           # Row sampling per tree
    colsample_bytree=0.8,    # Feature sampling per tree
    reg_alpha=0,             # L1 regularization
    reg_lambda=1,            # L2 regularization
)
```

### 5. LightGBM Improvements

**Key differences from XGBoost**:

1. **Leaf-wise growth** (instead of level-wise):
   - Splits leaf with max delta loss
   - Faster convergence
   - More prone to overfitting (use max_depth)

2. **Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS)**:
   - Keep all samples with large gradients
   - Random sample from small gradients
   - Speeds up training on large datasets

3. **Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB)**:
   - Bundle mutually exclusive features
   - Reduces number of features without losing information

**Usage**:
```python
import lightgbm as lgb

model = lgb.LGBMClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=-1,            # No limit (uses num_leaves instead)
    num_leaves=31,           # Max leaves per tree
    min_data_in_leaf=20,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8,
)
```

## Hyperparameter Tuning Guide

### Decision Trees

| Parameter | Description | Typical Range | Effect |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| max_depth | Maximum tree depth | 3-20 | ↑ depth → ↑ overfit |
| min_samples_split | Min samples to split | 2-50 | ↑ → ↓ overfit |
| min_samples_leaf | Min samples in leaf | 1-50 | ↑ → ↓ overfit |
| max_features | Features to consider | √d or log₂(d) | ↓ → ↓ overfit |
| max_leaf_nodes | Max leaves | 10-100 | ↓ → ↓ overfit |
| ccp_alpha | Pruning parameter | 0.0-0.1 | ↑ → ↓ overfit |

**Tuning strategy**:
1. Start with default (no limits)
2. If overfitting: add max_depth=5, min_samples_split=20
3. Fine-tune with grid search

### Random Forest

| Parameter | Description | Typical Range | Effect |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| n_estimators | Number of trees | 100-1000 | ↑ better (but slower) |
| max_depth | Tree depth | 10-50 or None | ↑ → ↑ overfit per tree |
| min_samples_split | Min samples to split | 2-20 | ↑ → ↓ overfit |
| max_features | Features per split | √d, log₂(d), 0.3 | Diversity vs accuracy |
| bootstrap | Use bootstrap | True | False = pasting |
| oob_score | Calculate OOB | True | Free validation |

**Tuning strategy**:
1. Start with n_estimators=100, defaults
2. Increase n_estimators until OOB score plateaus
3. Tune max_depth and min_samples_split if needed
4. Try different max_features values

**Example**:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from scipy.stats import randint

param_dist = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 500],
    'max_depth': [10, 20, 30, None],
    'min_samples_split': randint(2, 20),
    'max_features': ['sqrt', 'log2', 0.3]
}

rf = RandomForestClassifier(oob_score=True)
search = RandomizedSearchCV(rf, param_dist, n_iter=20, cv=5, n_jobs=-1)
search.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Best params: {search.best_params_}")
print(f"Best CV score: {search.best_score_}")
```

### XGBoost

| Parameter | Description | Typical Range | Effect |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| n_estimators | Number of trees | 100-1000 | ↑ better (watch for overfit) |
| learning_rate | Shrinkage | 0.01-0.3 | ↓ → need more trees |
| max_depth | Tree depth | 3-10 | ↑ → ↑ overfit |
| min_child_weight | Min weight in leaf | 1-10 | ↑ → ↓ overfit |
| gamma | Min loss reduction | 0-5 | ↑ → ↓ overfit |
| subsample | Row sampling | 0.5-1.0 | ↓ → ↓ overfit |
| colsample_bytree | Feature sampling | 0.5-1.0 | ↓ → ↓ overfit |
| reg_alpha | L1 regularization | 0-1 | ↑ → ↓ overfit |
| reg_lambda | L2 regularization | 0-1 | ↑ → ↓ overfit |

**Tuning strategy**:
1. Fix learning_rate=0.1, tune n_estimators with early stopping
2. Tune max_depth and min_child_weight
3. Tune gamma
4. Tune subsample and colsample_bytree
5. Tune regularization (reg_alpha, reg_lambda)
6. Lower learning_rate and increase n_estimators

**Example with early stopping**:
```python
import xgboost as xgb

dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(X_train, y_train)
dval = xgb.DMatrix(X_val, y_val)

params = {
    'objective': 'binary:logistic',
    'eval_metric': 'logloss',
    'learning_rate': 0.1,
    'max_depth': 6,
}

model = xgb.train(
    params,
    dtrain,
    num_boost_round=1000,
    evals=[(dval, 'validation')],
    early_stopping_rounds=50,
    verbose_eval=False
)

print(f"Best iteration: {model.best_iteration}")
```

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Imbalanced Classification

**Problem**: When one class is much more frequent than others (e.g., 95% negative, 5% positive).

**Solutions**:

**Option 1: Class weights**:
```python
from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight

class_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(y), y=y)
weight_dict = dict(zip(np.unique(y), class_weights))

rf = RandomForestClassifier(class_weight=weight_dict)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Option 2: Balanced Random Forest**:
```python
from imblearn.ensemble import BalancedRandomForestClassifier

brf = BalancedRandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
brf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Option 3: Threshold tuning**:
```python
# Get probability predictions
y_proba = rf.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

# Try different thresholds
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

best_threshold = 0.5
best_f1 = 0

for threshold in np.linspace(0.1, 0.9, 17):
    y_pred = (y_proba >= threshold).astype(int)
    f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
    
    if f1 > best_f1:
        best_f1 = f1
        best_threshold = threshold

print(f"Best threshold: {best_threshold}")
```

### 2. Multi-output Regression/Classification

**Problem**: Predict multiple targets simultaneously.

**Example**:
```python
# Predict [price, sqft, bedrooms] from location data
X = location_features
y = np.column_stack([prices, sqfts, bedrooms])

rf = RandomForestRegressor()
rf.fit(X, y)

predictions = rf.predict(X_test)  # Shape: (n_samples, 3)
```

**Note**: Each target gets its own set of trees, but they share the same structure.

### 3. Extremely Randomized Trees (Extra Trees)

**Difference from Random Forest**:
- RF: Bootstrap sample + find best split among random features
- Extra Trees: Whole dataset + random split thresholds

**Advantage**: Faster training (no sorting needed)
**Disadvantage**: Slightly worse performance

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier

et = ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=100)
et.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 4. Calibration

**Problem**: Tree-based models' probability estimates can be poorly calibrated.

**Solution**: Platt scaling or isotonic regression

```python
from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV

rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
calibrated_rf = CalibratedClassifierCV(rf, method='isotonic', cv=5)
calibrated_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Now probabilities are better calibrated
probs = calibrated_rf.predict_proba(X_test)
```

### 5. Partial Dependence Plots

**Visualize feature effect on predictions**:

```python
from sklearn.inspection import PartialDependenceDisplay

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 4))
PartialDependenceDisplay.from_estimator(
    rf, X, features=[0, 1, (0, 1)], 
    feature_names=feature_names,
    ax=ax
)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Shows how predictions change as feature values change, averaging over all other features.

### 6. SHAP Values

**More sophisticated feature importance**:

```python
import shap

explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(rf)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)

# Summary plot
shap.summary_plot(shap_values[1], X_test, feature_names=feature_names)

# Force plot for single prediction
shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[1], shap_values[1][0], X_test[0])
```

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) provides game-theoretic feature attributions.

    return np.array([predict_one(tree, x) for x in X])

# Test your implementation
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Use only 2 classes for binary classification
mask = y < 2
X = X[mask]
y = y[mask]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

**Expected output**: Your tree should achieve >90% accuracy on Iris binary classification.

### Part 2: Compare with sklearn

**Task**: Train sklearn's DecisionTreeClassifier on the same data and compare.

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Train sklearn tree
sklearn_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)
sklearn_tree.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
sklearn_pred = sklearn_tree.predict(X_test)

# Compare
sklearn_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, sklearn_pred)
print(f"sklearn tree accuracy: {sklearn_accuracy:.4f}")
print(f"Difference: {abs(accuracy - sklearn_accuracy):.4f}")
```

**Questions to answer**:
1. Why might your implementation differ from sklearn's?
2. What features does sklearn have that yours doesn't?

### Part 3: Build Random Forest

**Task**: Implement a simple Random Forest by combining multiple trees.

```python
class RandomForest:
    def __init__(self, n_trees=10, max_depth=5, max_features=None):
        self.n_trees = n_trees
        self.max_depth = max_depth

        # TODO: Implement this
        pass
    
    def predict(self, X):
        """
        Predict using majority vote
        
        Requirements:
        1. Get predictions from all trees
        2. Return majority vote for each sample
        """
        # TODO: Implement this
        pass

# Test your Random Forest
my_rf = RandomForest(n_trees=50, max_depth=5, max_features=int(np.sqrt(X.shape[1])))
my_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

rf_pred = my_rf.predict(X_test)
rf_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, rf_pred)

print(f"Your Random Forest accuracy: {rf_accuracy:.4f}")

# Compare with sklearn
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

sklearn_rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, max_depth=5, max_features='sqrt', random_state=42)
sklearn_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

sklearn_rf_pred = sklearn_rf.predict(X_test)
sklearn_rf_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, sklearn_rf_pred)

print(f"sklearn Random Forest accuracy: {sklearn_rf_accuracy:.4f}")
```

**Expected result**: Your Random Forest should achieve >95% accuracy.

### Part 4: Visualize Decision Boundaries

**Task**: Visualize how trees partition the feature space.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap

def plot_decision_boundary(model, X, y, title):
    """
    Plot decision boundary for 2D data
    """
    h = 0.02  # Step size

    y_min, y_max = X[:, 1].min() - 1, X[:, 1].max() + 1
    xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, h),
                         np.arange(y_min, y_max, h))
    
    # Predict on mesh
    Z = model.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
    Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)
    
    # Plot
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha=0.4, cmap=ListedColormap(['#FFAAAA', '#AAAAFF']))
    plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, s=20, edgecolor='k', cmap=ListedColormap(['#FF0000', '#0000FF']))
    plt.title(title)
    plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
    plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

# Use only first 2 features for visualization
X_2d = X_train[:, :2]
X_test_2d = X_test[:, :2]

# Build trees on 2D data
single_tree = build_tree(X_2d, y_train, max_depth=3)
my_rf_2d = RandomForest(n_trees=50, max_depth=3)
my_rf_2d.fit(X_2d, y_train)

# Plot
plot_decision_boundary(lambda x: predict(single_tree, x), X_2d, y_train, 
                       'Single Decision Tree (depth=3)')
plot_decision_boundary(my_rf_2d, X_2d, y_train, 
                       'Random Forest (50 trees, depth=3)')
```

**Observations to make**:
1. How do single tree boundaries look? (Rectangular, axis-aligned)
2. How does RF smooth the boundaries?
3. Where does each model overfit or underfit?

```python
def calculate_feature_importance(tree, n_features):
    """
    Calculate feature importance based on total impurity decrease

class GradientBoostingRegressor:
    def __init__(self, n_trees=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3):
        self.n_trees = n_trees

        pass
    
    def predict(self, X):
        """
        Sum predictions from all trees
        """
        # TODO: Implement this
        pass

# Test on regression problem
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

X_reg, y_reg = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, noise=10, random_state=42)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: When should I use Random Forest vs XGBoost?**
A: Quick guideline:
- Start with Random Forest: Easier to tune, robust, good baseline
- Use XGBoost when: You need that extra 2-5% accuracy, have time to tune, competing in Kaggle

**Q: How many trees should I use?**
A: 
- Random Forest: 100-500 usually sufficient. More doesn't hurt (just slower).
- XGBoost: Use early stopping. Usually 100-1000 with learning_rate=0.1.

**Q: My tree overfits even with max_depth=3. What should I do?**
A:
1. Check for data leakage
2. Increase min_samples_leaf
3. Try feature selection
4. Use ensemble (RF/XGBoost) instead of single tree

**Q: Can trees handle missing values?**
A:
- sklearn: No, must impute first
- XGBoost/LightGBM: Yes, they learn best direction for missing values

**Q: Why is my Random Forest worse than a single tree?**
A: Usually means:
- Too few trees (increase n_estimators)
- max_features too small (trees are too similar)
- Data is very small (<100 samples)

**Q: When should I NOT use trees?**
A:
- High-dimensional sparse data (text, genomics) → Linear models, deep learning
- Need extrapolation → Linear regression
- Need well-calibrated probabilities → Logistic regression, calibrated models
- Very smooth relationships → Neural networks, polynomial regression

**Q: How do I handle categorical features?**
A:
- sklearn: One-hot encode before fitting
- XGBoost: Can handle `enable_categorical=True` (experimental)
- LightGBM: Native categorical support with `categorical_feature` parameter

tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(
    max_depth=5,
    min_samples_split=20,
    min_samples_leaf=10
)

# Random Forest (quick baseline)
rf = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=None,
    min_samples_split=2,
    max_features='sqrt',
    oob_score=True
)

# XGBoost (for competitions)
xgb = XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=6,
    min_child_weight=1,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8
)
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. ❌ Forgetting to handle missing values for sklearn
2. ❌ Not checking for data leakage
3. ❌ Using trees for high-dimensional sparse data
4. ❌ Expecting trees to extrapolate beyond training range
5. ❌ Not using early stopping with gradient boosting
6. ❌ Tuning too many hyperparameters at once
7. ❌ Ignoring class imbalance
8. ❌ Using default parameters for XGBoost in production
